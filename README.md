Task 2: Performance Optimization
Objective
The goal of this task was to improve website loading speed, mobile responsiveness, and security for the Kogniti Minds website hosted on Hostinger.

Tools Used
Google PageSpeed Insights – to measure desktop & mobile performance.

GTmetrix – to analyze speed and bottlenecks.

Hostinger hPanel – for cache, GZIP, and SSL settings.

Chrome DevTools – for mobile responsiveness testing.

Optimization Steps

The following optimizations were applied using Hostinger hPanel and standard best practices:

✅ Enabled Cache Manager (to reduce repeated server requests)


✅ Enabled GZIP Compression (to compress CSS/JS/HTML files for faster delivery)


✅ SSL (HTTPS) Active (to ensure secure data transfer)


✅ Checked Mobile Responsiveness (using Chrome DevTools iPhone 12 emulation)

Website loading speed improved on both Desktop and Mobile.

Mobile responsiveness was verified and optimized.

Security improved with SSL (HTTPS).

Optimizations like caching and GZIP compression helped reduce page size and load time.

Overall, the website is now faster, secure, and mobile-friendly.
